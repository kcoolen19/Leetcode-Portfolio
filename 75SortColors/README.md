# CODE DESCRIPTION
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0] <b/r>
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2] <b/r>

Example 2: 

Input: nums = [2,0,1]<b/r>
Output: [0,1,2]
