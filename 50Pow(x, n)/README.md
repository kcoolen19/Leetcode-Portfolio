# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn). <br /> 

Example 1: <br />

Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10 <br /> 
Output: 1024.00000 

Example 2: <br />

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3 <br /> 
Output: 9.26100

Example 3: <br /> 

Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2 <br /> 
Output: 0.25000 <br /> 
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
 

Constraints: <br /> 
~ -100.0 < x < 100.0 <br /> 
~ -231 <= n <= 231-1 <br /> 
~ n is an integer. <br /> 
~ Either x is not zero or n > 0. <br /> 
~ -104 <= xn <= 104 <br />
