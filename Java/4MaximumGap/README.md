# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Given an integer array nums, return the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form. If the array contains less than two elements, return 0.<br />

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

Example 1: <br />
Input: nums = [3,6,9,1]<br />
Output: 3<br />
Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.<br />


Example 2: <br />
Input: nums = [10]<br />
Output: 0<br />
Explanation: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.
