# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1: <br />
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2] <br />
Output: 4 <br />
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4. 

Example 2: <br />
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1] <br />
Output: 9
